Larry Llamas Great Adventure

My goal with this project was mainly to tell a story. I tried to infuse a little of my story into Larry's adventure. 
I incorporated some common design patterns like a slideshow/hero image, pop out nav, client-side form validation and 
split color content sections. This project was a lot of fun to work on and a real challenge to try to complete in 7 days.
I can acknowledge that there is plenty of room for improvement but overall, Iâ€™m happy with the end result and I hope that you 
enjoy taking a look around!
